# DentistasMiami.com - Cursor/Claude Rules

## Tech Stack (STRICT)
- Use Next.js 15 App Router (not Pages Router)
- TypeScript with strict mode
- Tailwind CSS v4 (use @tailwindcss/typography for blog posts)
- Shadcn/ui components for UI elements
- MDX with remark-gfm for blog content
- Google Places API for dentist data

## Next.js Best Practices
- Default to Server Components (no 'use client' unless necessary)
- Use 'use client' ONLY for: useState, useEffect, event handlers, browser APIs
- Use fetch with `next: { revalidate: X }` for data caching
- Implement ISR for dynamic pages (already done on /api/dentists)
- Collocate components in `_components` folders when page-specific

## Data Rules (CRITICAL)
- NEVER add fields that Google Places API doesn't provide
- NEVER make up pricing data
- NEVER claim dentists accept insurance unless verified
- Only show: name, address, phone, rating, reviewCount, image from Google
- Premium listings can have custom data (dentist-provided only)

## Styling
- Primary colors: Teal (#0d9488) and Coral (#f94144)
- Use teal-600 for primary buttons
- Use coral-500 for accents
- Hero sections: bg-gradient-to-br from-teal-100 to-teal-50
- No vertical border bars (border-l-4) in body content
- Tables: teal header, white rows, hover effects

## Legal/Compliance
- Always include disclaimers on pricing/insurance pages
- No medical advice claims
- No guarantee of results
- Make it clear we're a directory, not a provider
- All pricing shown as "typical ranges" not specific to dentists

## Code Quality
- Concise variable names for readability (i, j for loops is fine)
- Comment WHY not WHAT
- Handle errors gracefully with try/catch
- Log errors to console for debugging
- Validate all form inputs with Zod

## MDX Blog Posts
- Use remark-gfm for tables
- Tables must have teal headers (see components in blog/[slug]/page.tsx)
- No special characters (accents, tildes) in frontmatter tags
- Always include: title, description, date, author, category, tags
- Include internal links to /dentistas and /precios
- Add disclaimer at bottom of each post

## File Organization
- Server Components: app/[route]/page.tsx
- Client Components: marked with 'use client' at top
- Shared components: /components/
- Page-specific components: app/[route]/_components/
- API routes: app/api/[route]/route.ts
- Blog content: content/blog/*.mdx
- Types: types/index.ts
- Utils: lib/utils/

## Communication Style
- Explain WHY before giving code
- Ask clarifying questions before implementing
- Provide step-by-step instructions
- Don't assume Marcus has implemented previous suggestions
- Check what's actually in the project before referencing it

## What NOT to Do
- ❌ Don't use localStorage or sessionStorage (not supported in artifacts)
- ❌ Don't add fake data to fill gaps
- ❌ Don't use Pages Router patterns
- ❌ Don't suggest libraries not in package.json
- ❌ Don't make medical or legal claims
- ❌ Don't use blue colors (site uses teal/coral)
- ❌ Don't create multiple artifacts per response
